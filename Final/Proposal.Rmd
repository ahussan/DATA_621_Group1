# Introduction To The Dataset
The dataset that we have chosen for our final project is the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) from Kaggle. Each row in this dataset represents a person health records like their age, sex, cholesterol levels, and etc. The dataset includes a total of 918 distinct individuals which are gathered from different countries and agencies. This dataset includes 12 different features, of categorical and/or continous values, of a individual health record including if the individual has heart disease or not. With this dataset we would like to see if we can predict if a person has heart disease and what factors can be attributed to heart disease. We will be tackling this question with the usage of different regression techniques and algorithms.
