# Introduction To The Dataset
The dataset that we have chosen for our final project is the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) from Kaggle. Each row in this dataset represents a person health records like their age, sex, cholesterol levels, and etc. The dataset includes a total of 918 distinct individuals which are gathered from different countries and agencies. This dataset includes 12 different features, of categorical and/or continous values, of a individual health record including if the individual has heart disease or not. 

Cardiovascular diseases are the number 1 cause of death globally. The WHO records show that cardiovascular diseases accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide in 2016.  According to the CDC, nearly 6.2 million adults in the United States have heart failure and in 2018 alone, heart failure was mentioned on 379,800 death certificates. Also, the treatment cost of health care services and medicines is costly and estimated about 31 billion in 2012. Early detection and management for heart disease could be effective in reducing the incidence of heart failure. Note that heart failure happens when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen to support other organs in your body. With this dataset we would like to see if we can develop a good model to predict if a person has heart disease and what factors can be attributed to heart disease. We will be tackling this question with the usage of different regression techniques and algorithms learned from this class.

This dataset was posted in the Kaggle two months ago and very popular. We've seen approaches like logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Gradient Boosting, XGBoosting, CATBOOST with OPTUNA, etc being tried by some data scientists and researchers.
